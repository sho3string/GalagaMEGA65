Version 0.5.0 - August 6, 2023
==============================

Galaga for the MEGA65 version 0.5.0 is based on this version 1.0.0 of the MiSTer2MEGA65 framework.

Despite being labeled as a "beta" release, the game is entirely playable with no major issues however, users will encounter a lower framerate in rotate mode. It's important to note that this is not due to any limitations in the Mega65's hardware, but rather a constraint in the M2M framework. Presently, screen rotation is only supported at 50hz, whereas Galaga's video runs at 60hz. For the best experience, it is recommended not ( despite this being the default ) to rotate the display via the OSD (On-Screen Display) but rather to physically rotate your monitor instead. This limitation will be fixed in the future.

## Features
* Screen rotation of 90Â° is available, although not recommended (please see above for more information)

* Supports Midway and Namco versions, featuring fast shoot hacks.

## Constraints 
* Core does not support dynamic ROM loading yet

## Bugs
* Game may enter an undesired state when unpausing the game or leaving the OSD menu, it is currently unknown as to what is the cause
* Dimming the screen during pause is currently not working, this will be fixed at some point
